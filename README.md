# Title - Predictive Maintainance Analysis

# Discription of Project

- This project is related to a mechanical industry, Sometimes in industries unexpected machine failures occurs due to    improper handling, power cutoff, faulty instrument, improper machine parameters given by operator. 
- By analysing and finding insights from the Dataset of drilling tool which is used on lathe machine in mechanical 
  industry we created a model using a machine learning algorithm which predict if machine will get failure or not.

# Future scope This Project - 

- By using this model we can improve the productivity of companies.
- We can easily predict  machine will fail or not before start the production by providing input parameters.
- Prevent the machine from failures.
- Improves the safety features from accidents.
  
- Language used (PYTHON, EXCEL)
- Accuracy of the project â€“ 99 %

# Prescriptive Analysis
   After studying the dataset, we can see that machine failure is mainly occuring because of 3 reasons:
   1. Improper rotational speed of the spindle.
   2. Torque not maintained as per the requirement.
   3. High tool wear.

# Measures to take in order to avoid failure.
    1. User must set the rotational speed properly. Not too high and also not too low.
    2. User should not set the torque too high or too low. Torque should be set as per the tool requirement.
    3. User should not use the same tool for long period of time. Since tools may wear due to excessive usage.
    4. High quality and medium quality products should be used more frequently.
    5. Overheating of tool must be avoided by constantly providing coolant to the tool. 
    6. Secondary power input shoould be provided in case of power failure
